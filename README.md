# splihx.js

`splihx.js` is a set of [Splix](https://splix.io/) hacks which incorporates many functions that can greatly improve in-game experience. Note that this project is only intended for educational purposes, and not intended for proper gameplay. The author urges you not to use this in regular gaming, as this may break the balance between gamers.

These functions are implemented in the project, but only those with checkboxes ticked are enabled by default, and need to be manually enabled in order to be used.

-   [ ] Remove full-screen and banner advertisements.
-   [ ] Forcefully enable skin changing without the need to share it on Facebook, Twitter, etc.
-   [x] Make other players more visible by highlighting them with distinguished colours.
-   [x] Render certain colours (pink, lime and yellow) in a way that won't blind your eyes.
-   [x] **Add zooming functions in order to gain a wider view range of players.**

## Controls

-   `Z` to zoom out 100% each time. This can be extended to 8 times the original view range.
-   `X` to zoom in 100% each time. This can be at least half of the original view range.
-   `C` to stop the current player, which is an alias of the retained `P` function.

## Installation

1.  Download the `splihx.js` file to your local computer or view it on GitHub.
2.  Open the **Developer Console** in your Splix tab (This is usually `F12` for most browsers).
3.  Copy all content in `splihx.js` to the **Developer Console** and press `Enter` to execute the script.
4.  Your instance of Splix should be hacked by now.
5.  If you reloaded your browser window, you may have to redo the process.

## Notes

**The current version of `splihx.js` works with `splix` v.142 only.**

In consideration of the income of the author of Splix, we decided that the automatic removal of the advertisements should not be turned on by default, although no explicit notices of such are displayed on its official website. If you really need this function due to various reasons, for instance, having certain services blocked, please turn this on manually in the script.

Also, to encourage the spread of this game, we decided that the force enabling of skin customization should not be turned on by default. This function is only intended for those lacking an open network, therefore not begin accessible to Facebook, Twitter and other services, and shall be turned on manually in the script.

**To Splix authors: if any part of this program infringes your rights or interests, we suggest your immediate communication with us, who shall remove related segments of this program or, if necessary, the entire project from the public domain.**
